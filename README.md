UBER TEST
=============

Files for my REST API server written in Python(Flask MicroFrameWork) and a web client written in Javascript (Knockout).

I usually work in the LAMP framework. But decided to learn the Flask MicroFrameWork and dabble a little in Python and Javascript. Really enjoyed the exercise and went through some tutorial online to find how python can be used to create REST API and the front end was also interesting to write, as I have not been programming in javascript for a long time. 

Database used is sqlite, using the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension to manage the application. This extension provides a wrapper for the SQLAlchemy project, which is an Object Relational Mapper or ORM

I have based this coding example using http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world. As I do not have any experience in python web programming. It was definitely a fun challenge to learn from this tutorial and change the code around to meet my requirements.
